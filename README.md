Cloud Security Architect with strong hands-on experience across GCP, AWS, and Azure, specializing in security automation, cloud hardening, and compliance at scale. I design and implement cloud security controls, close audit gaps, and help organizations move toward mature DevSecOps practices with Terraform, CI/CD security, and Zero Trust principles.

My recent work includes leading GCP security posture improvements at Urban Sports Club (post-acquisition), remediating 600+ Vanta controls, building reusable Terraform guardrails (flow logs, SQL monitoring, IAM conditions), and aligning multi-team processes across SRE, Platform, and Compliance. I focus on practical, scalable solutions that improve visibility, reduce risk, and create long-term maintainable security baselines in cloud environments.

I bring a hybrid background across cloud engineering, security architecture, and DevSecOps, plus international experience across Europe and North America.

Key Skills:
• Cloud Security: GCP, AWS, Azure
• DevSecOps: Terraform, CI/CD governance, GitHub security automation
• Compliance: Vanta, ISO 27001, SOC2 evidence automation
• Architecture: IAM, network segmentation, org-level guardrails
• Operations: Security posture management, logging pipelines, threat surface reduction
• Delivery: Presales to implementation, cross-team alignment, technical leadership

Open to:
Cloud Security Architect, DevSecOps Architect, Platform Security, GCP Security, and related contract or full-time roles across EU/UK (remote-first).
